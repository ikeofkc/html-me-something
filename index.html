    <h1>The man &amp; his dream.</h1>
    <h2>The Epiphany</h2>

        There once was a man form Nantucket, a small man, with a gigatic will. He had big pants to fill after taking over as CTO at Self-Service Solutions LLC, a company speciallizing in robotic solutions for sole proprietorships.  One day, the man thought, "What if I could extend myself, not just augment my abilities. What if I was more than short, thin, engineer in Massachusetts."  He wanted to be able to do what he wanted by himself. No more would he need help from a colleague, or at times a team. So he set to work on shifting the company to incorporate biological enhancement solutions...

    <h2>The planning</h2>
    <p>

    In his mind, he had all kinds of enhancements in mind. He began to jot them down in his note pad, dividing his ideas, for both mind and body. Being business centered, he didn't want to enhance everything all at once, so he would make small enhancements that target small adjustments. For the mind his ideas were:
    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced memory</li>
        <li>Enhanced read speed</li>
        <li>Enhanced ability to come up with better ideas for assignments.</li>
    </ul>
    For the body his ideas were:
    <ul>
        <li>Longer limbs</li>
        <li>Thicker, meatier limbs</li>
        <li>Enhance performance duration</li>
        <li>Enhanced lung capacity</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>The Research</h2>
    <p> 
        <img src="./images/research.jpg" alt="Thinking of a dream..." style="float:left;width:200px;padding-right:30px;">
        The man directed the whole company to research biological enhancements from simple nutrient solutions to CRISPR gene editing solutions. At the beggining he worked along side his staff, but as time grew on he moved much of his work to a separate offiec and asked that all work be placed in a mail slot.  As the team made further progress, the man became more of a recluse in his office. One day he sent out a memo that everyone was being laid off effective immediately.  The man did not even leave his office break the bad news, or to wish anyone well.

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <p> 
        <img src="./images/light.jpg" alt="Thinking of a dream..." style="float:right;width:200px;padding-right:30px;">
        The employees assumed that the company was being liquidated or sold, but that was not the case.  Lights from his office could still be seen from the outside months later. What was happening in the building? No one knew.  Rumors and stories still plague Nantucket, MA today.
