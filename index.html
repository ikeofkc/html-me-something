                <h2>The Epiphany</h2>
                    <p> 
                        There once was a man from Nantucket. He was a small man with big pants to fill. He had just taken over as CEO of Self-Service Solutions LLC, a company speciallizing in robotic solutions for sole proprietorships.  One day, the man thought, "What if I could extend myself, not just augment my abilities. What if I was more than a short, thin, engineer in Massachusetts."  He wanted to be able to do what he wanted by himself. No more would he need help from a colleague, or at times a team. So he set to work on shifting the company to incorporate biological enhancement solutions...

                <h2>The planning</h2>
                    <p>
                        In his mind, he had all kinds of enhancements in mind. He began to jot them down in his note pad, dividing his ideas, for both mind and body. Being business centered, he didn't want to enhance everything all at once, so he would make small enhancements that target small adjustments. For the mind his ideas were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enhanced memory</li>
                            <li>Enhanced read speed</li>
                            <li>Enhanced ability to come up with better ideas for assignments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For the body, his ideas were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Longer limbs</li>
                            <li>Thicker, meatier limbs</li>
                            <li>Enhance performance duration</li>
                            <li>Enhanced lung capacity</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <h2>The Research</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The man directed the whole company to research biological enhancements from simple nutrient solutions to CRISPR gene editing solutions. As the team made further progress, the man became more of a recluse in his office. One day he sent out a memo that everyone was being laid off effective immediately.

                <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The employees assumed that the company was being liquidated, but that was not the case.  Lights from his office could still be seen from the outside months later. Some say they could hear ghostly moans from outside.  What was happening in the building?  Rumors and stories still plague Nantucket, MA today.
