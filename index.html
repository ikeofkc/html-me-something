    <h1>The man &amp; his dream.</h1>
    <h2>The idea</h2>

        There once was a man form Nantucket, a small man, with a gigatic will. He had big pants to fill after taking over as CTO at Self-Service Solutions LLC, a company speciallizing in robotic solutions for sole proprietorships.  One day, the man thought, "What if I could extend myself, not just augment my abilities. What if I was more than short, thin, engineer in Massachusetts."  He wanted to be able to do what he wanted by himself, without help from a colleague. So he set to work on shifting the company to incorporate biological enhancement solutions...

    <h2>Planning</h2>

    In his mind, he had all kinds of enhancements in mind. He began to jot them down in his note pad, dividing his ideas, for both mind and body. Being business centered, he didn't want to enhance everything all at once, so he would make small enhancements that target small adjustments.
